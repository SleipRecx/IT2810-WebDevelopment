###React Components###


###Sass###

The Style.css is compiled from several Sass scripts. this allows us to modify the style on individual components as needed and include this in our main Sass file.

When we run the "NPM run sass" the stylesheet style.css is recompiled an updated. We also have a watcher attached when running "Npm run watchsass" or "npm run dev" so we can view real time changes as we update the code.
